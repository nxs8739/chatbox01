[21-Dec-2023 18:11:49] Beanz: feeling pretty good about the site and how it&#039;s looking. what are your opinions?

[23-Dec-2023 22:25:07] Beanz: docker is having intermittent problems that will be up and down so if you go to the site and it doesn&#039;t work that is why. please bear with me as i address the issue.

[24-Dec-2023 23:38:03] Beanz: speedtest was limited to 12mbps download due to being hosted on local network. it is now hosted by open speed test and should correctly test speeds up to 1000 mbps
